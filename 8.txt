Measures of Dispersion are used to represent the scattering of data. These are the numbers that show the various aspects of the data spread across various parameters.

Let’s learn about the measure of dispersion in statistics , its types, formulas, and examples in detail.

Dispersion in statistics is a way to describe how spread out or scattered the data is around an average value. It helps to understand if the data points are close together or far apart. 

Dispersion shows the variability or consistency in a set of data. There are different measures of dispersion like range, variance, and standard deviation. 

Measures of Dispersion measure the scattering of the data. It tells us how the values are distributed in the data set. In statistics, we define the measure of dispersion as various parameters that are used to define the various attributes of the data.

These measures of dispersion capture variation between different values of the data.

Measures of dispersion can be classified into the following two types :  

These measures of dispersion can be further divided into various categories. They have various parameters and these parameters have the same unit.



Let’s learn about them in detail.

The measures of dispersion that are measured and expressed in the units of data themselves are called Absolute Measure of Dispersion. For example – Meters, Dollars, Kg, etc. 

Some absolute measures of dispersion are: 

Range: It is defined as the difference between the largest and the smallest value in the distribution.

Mean Deviation: It is the arithmetic mean of the difference between the values and their mean.

Standard Deviation: It is the square root of the arithmetic average of the square of the deviations measured from the mean.

Variance: It is defined as the average of the square deviation from the mean of the given data set.

Quartile Deviation: It is defined as half of the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile in a given data set.

Interquartile Range: The difference between upper(Q3 ) and lower(Q1) quartile is called Interterquartile Range. Its formula is given as Q3 – Q1.

We use relative measures of dispersion to measure the two quantities that have different units to get a better idea about the scattering of the data.

Here are some of the  relative measures of dispersion:

Coefficient of Range: It is defined as the ratio of the difference between the highest and lowest value in a data set to the sum of the highest and lowest value.

Coefficient of Variation: It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the data set. We use percentages to express the coefficient of variation.

Coefficient of Mean Deviation: It is defined as the ratio of the mean deviation to the value of the central point of the data set.

Coefficient of Quartile Deviation: It is defined as the ratio of the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile to the sum of the third and first quartiles.

The range is the difference between the largest and the smallest values in the distribution. 

Thus, it can be written as

R = L – S

where,

L is the largest value in the Distribution

S is the smallest value in the Distribution

Example: Find the range of the data set 10, 20, 15, 0, 100.

Solution:

Thus, the range of the data set is,

R = 100 – 0

R = 100

Note: Range cannot be calculated for the open-ended frequency distributions. Open-ended frequency distributions are those distributions in which either the lower limit of the lowest class or the higher limit of the highest class is not defined. 

To find the range for the ungrouped data set,  first we have to find the smallest and the largest value of the data set by observing. The difference between them gives the range of ungrouped data. 

We can understyand this with the help of following example:

Example: Find out the range for the following observations, 20, 24, 31, 17, 45, 39, 51, 61.

Solution:

Thus, the range of the data set is

Range = 61 – 17 = 44

The range of the grouped data set is found by studying the following example,

Example: Find out the range for the following frequency distribution table for the marks scored by class 10 students. 

Solution:

Range = 40 – 0 

Thus, the range of the given data set is,

Range = 40 

Mean deviation measures the deviation of the observations from the mean of the distribution.

Since the average is the central value of the data, some deviations might be positive and some might be negative. If they are added like that, their sum will not reveal much as they tend to cancel each other’s effect.

For example :

Let us consider this set of data : -5, 10, 25

Mean = (-5 + 10 + 25)/3 = 10

Now a deviation from the mean for different values is,

Now adding the deviations, shows that there is zero deviation from the mean which is incorrect. Thus, to counter this problem only the absolute values of the difference are taken while calculating the mean deviation.

Mean Deviation Formula :

 MD = 

For calculating the mean deviation for ungrouped data, the following steps must be followed: 

Step 1: Calculate the arithmetic mean for all the values of the dataset.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between each value of the dataset and the mean. Only absolute values of the differences will be considered. |d|

Step 3: Calculate the arithmetic mean of these deviations using the formula,

M.D = 

This can be explained using the example.

Example: Calculate the mean deviation for the given ungrouped data, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Solution: 

Mean(μ) = (2+4+6+8+10)/(5)

μ = 6

M. D = 

⇒ M.D = 

⇒ M.D = (4+2+0+2+4)/(5)

⇒ M.D = 12/5 = 2.4

where,Q3 = Third Quartile and Q1 = First Quartile

Coefficients of dispersion are calculated when two series are compared, which have great differences in their average. We also use co-efficient of dispersion for comparing two series that have different measurements. It is denoted using the letters C.D.

(Mean Deviation)/μ

where,

μ is the central point for which the mean is calculated

Both Measures of Dispersion and Central Tendency are numbers that are used to describe various parameters of the data. Let’s see the differences between Measures of Dispersion and Central Tendency.

Let’s solve some questions on the Measures of Dispersion.

Examples 1: Find out the range for the following observations. {20, 42, 13, 71, 54, 93, 15, 16}

Solution:

Given,

Thus, the range of the data set is,

Range = 71 – 13

Range = 58

Example 2: Find out the range for the following frequency distribution table for the marks scored by class 10 students. 

Solution:

Given,

Range = 40 – 10

Range = 30

Thus, the range of the data set is 30.

Example 3: Calculate the mean deviation for the given ungrouped data {-5, -4, 0, 4, 5}

Solution: 

Mean(μ) = {(-5)+(-4)+(0)+(4)+(5)}/5

μ = 0/5 = 0

M. D = 

⇒ M.D = 

⇒ M.D = (5+4+0+4+5)/5

⇒ M.D = 18/5

⇒ M.D = 3.6

Measure of Dispersion is the positive real numbers that are used to define the variability of the data set about any central point.

Measures of Dispersion are classified into two types :

Absolute Measures of Dispersion are the statistical tools that provide the actual spread of data, like range and standard deviation. They have the same units as the data.

Relative Measure of Dispersions show the spread of data relative to its central value, without unit dependency. They are statistical comparisons, expressed as ratios or percentages, like the coefficient of variation.

Absolute measures of dispersion provide the actual spread of data, like range, variance, standard deviation. They are expressed in the same units as the data. Relative measures of dispersion, on the other hand, compare the spread relative to the central value, usually as a ratio or percentage. They are unitless, allowing for comparison between different datasets.

Dispersion is calculated by using various formulas for mean, standard deviation, variance, etc.

Examples of dispersion in statistics include: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range (IQR), Coefficient of Variation, etc.
