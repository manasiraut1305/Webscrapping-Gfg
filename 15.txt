Congruence of triangles is the property of two triangles in which all three corresponding sides and corresponding angles are equal. Two triangles are said to be congruent if and only if they can be overlapped with each other completely.

In this article, we are going to learn about the different criteria for the Congruence of Triangles with the help of solved examples.

Congruent triangles are triangles that are perfect copies of one another. Various congruence rules are used to prove the congruency in two triangles. 

Congruent triangles if arranged in proper orientation are mirror images of each other. The corresponding angle and dimensions of congruent figures are the same.

The symbol used to show congruency between two objects is “≅”. To show congruency between them we write Δ ABC ≅ Δ PQR.



The full form of CPCT is Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles. This is a fundamental rule used to establish equality of various parts of triangles based on their congruence.

It states that if two triangles are congruent, then each of their corresponding parts (angles and sides) are equal.

The different criteria used to prove congruency between two triangles are:

They are also called the postulates or rules for the congruence of triangles. Let’s discuss them in detail.

In the postulate of SSS, if all three sides of a triangle are equal to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, then it satisfies the condition of SSS.



In the above-given figure, we can see that, AB = QR, BC = RP, and CA = PQ . Hence, Δ ABC ≅ Δ QRP

In the postulate of SAS, in comparison among two triangles, if two sides and the angle included between two sides are equal. Then it satisfies the condition of SAS.



In the above-given figure, we can see that, CB = RQ, BA = QP, and ∠B = ∠Q. Hence, Δ CBA ≅ Δ RQP.

Here, if we are having two triangles, where any two angles and sides included between the two angles of one triangle are equal to the angles and sides of the corresponding triangle. Then the two triangles will satisfy the ASA congruency.



In the above-given figure, we can see that,AB = PQ, ∠A = ∠P, and ∠B = ∠Q. Hence,  ΔACB ≅  ΔPQR.

If any two angles of a triangle and non-included side are equal to the two angles and side of the corresponding triangle, then it will satisfy the AAS congruency. 



From the given figure, we can say that, BC = QR,∠A = ∠P, and ∠B = ∠QHence, ΔACB ≅  ΔDFE

In RHS congruency, if only two sides i.e. hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the corresponding hypotenuse and side of another right-angled triangle, then we can say that RHS Congruence Rule is satisfied.



From the above-given example of a right-angled triangle, we get ∠B = ∠Q (right angles)CA = RP and AB = PQ. Hence, ΔACB ≅ ΔDFE.

Note– RHS criteria of congruence get satisfied only with a right-angled triangle.

Let’s solve some questions on the congruence of triangles.

Example 1: Check whether the given triangles are congruent or not also, write the congruency criteria for congruency in triangles.



Solution:

To identify the congruency in the above triangle.

BC = QR = 4 units (given)

CA = RP = 5 units (given)

∠ABC = ∠PQR = 90°

Now, we can conclude that Δ ABC ≅ Δ PQR by the RHS congruency condition.

Example 2: Check whether the given triangles are congruent or not also, write the congruency criteria for congruency in triangles.

Congruent triangles are triangles that can overlap one another if arranged in a specific orientation. All three corresponding sides and corresponding angles in a congruent triangle are equal.

The five main rules for congruency of triangles are

SSS Rule: Side-Side-SideSAS Rule: Side-Angle-SideASA Rule: Angle-Side-AngleAAS Rule: Angle-Angle-SideRHS Rule: Right angle- Hypotenuse-Side

CPCT is an abbreviation for Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles. CPCT says if two or more triangles are congruent to each other, then the corresponding angles and the corresponding sides of the triangles are also congruent to each other.

If all the three corresponding sides of two corresponding triangles are equal then the triangles are said to be congruent by SSS congruency condition.

The SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence of triangles states hat if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) congruence of triangles states that if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) congruence states that if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruency states that if the hypotenuse and one other side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the corresponding hypotenuse and side of another right-angled triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

No, AAA criterion cant be used for proving congruency in triangles. AAA criterion can be used for proving Similarities between two triangles.

No, all similar triangles are not congruent, but all congruent triangles are similar.
